## What this is

This repository defines the **operations-domain specialization** for DevSecOps / AIOps / AI4IT operational intelligence, covering:

- AI4IT topic ladder and maturity model
- Ops entity extraction schemas and mapping DSL
- Story grouping, explainability, and feedback loops
- Operational measurement plane
- External seed ontology imports relevant to the operations-domain profile (currently IBM ITOPS)
- Mapping layers from external ontologies into the operations-domain profile
- Evidence-oriented operational graph projections scoped to this profile
- GitHub footprint alignment against workspace topology, ontology scaffolding, and website surface taxonomy
- operational exhaust fusion across CI/CD, runtime, policy/evidence, market/execution, and trader-agent lanes

This repository does **not** own canonical platform storage standards, canonical wire contracts, or the sole canonical platform ontology / broader knowledge semantics.

## Ownership boundaries

| Repository | Owns |
|---|---|
| `socioprophet-standards-storage` | Base transport, storage, and interface invariants; canonical envelope and wire contracts |
| `ontogenesis` / `socioprophet-standards-knowledge` | Canonical ontology and broader knowledge semantics |
| **`global-devsecops-intelligence`** | Operations-domain profile; external seed ontology imports relevant to that profile; mapping layers; domain-scoped operational graph projections |

Institutional digital-twin semantics may appear here only insofar as they are needed to support the operations-domain profile. Where a concept has both a platform-wide canonical meaning and an operations-domain specialization, the canonical meaning remains upstream and this repository maintains only the specialization, binding, mapping, or projection.

Dependency direction:
```
platform standards → knowledge / ontology standards → global-devsecops-intelligence → runtime implementations
```

## Status

### External seed ontology

| Seed | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IBM ITOPS / `GLO_V1.ttl` | metadata-first import | Preferred first payload for semantic alignment — see `third_party/ibm-itops/` |
| `ITOPS_S1`, `ITOPS_S2`, `ITOPS_S3` | deferred | Deferred until vendoring, validation, and query strategy are approved |

### GitHub-footprint alignment

| Plane | Provider | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Repository inventory / role ontology / dependency graph | `sociosphere` | active |
| Provenance / policy / ontology-alignment scaffold | `ontogenesis` | active |
| Normalized operational taxonomy for surfaces, workflow states, and capability routing | website surface inventory + public docs | active |
| Machine-readable profile | `profiles/github-footprint-itops-expansion.yaml` | draft `v0.1.0` |

See [`docs/architecture/github-footprint-itops-alignment.md`](docs/architecture/github-footprint-itops-alignment.md) for the full integration model.

### Operational-exhaust fusion

| Artifact | Status |
|---|---|
| `docs/devops/operational-exhaust-and-trader-agent-fusion.md` | draft |
| `profiles/operational-exhaust-fusion-profile.v0.yaml` | draft |
| `docs/adr/0002-operational-exhaust-and-trader-agent-fusion-boundary.md` | accepted |
